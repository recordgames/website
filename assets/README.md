# Starstruck Galaxy Assets

Place the sliced hero parallax layers and other imagery for the website in this directory. Update the file names in `styles.css` to match your final assets. Suggested naming convention:

- `hero-logo.png`
- `hero-far-background.png`
- `hero-near-background.png`
- `hero-far-foreground.png`
- `hero-near-foreground.png`

Optimize images for web delivery (WebP or AVIF recommended) and consider providing fallback formats for maximum compatibility. Ensure transparent layers preserve alpha channels for the parallax composition.
