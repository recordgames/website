# Custom Fonts

Add the BM Hanna Pro font files in this directory to enable the custom typography used across the site. The stylesheet expects a `BMHannaPro.woff2` file by default:

```
fonts/
  └── BMHannaPro.woff2
```

Update `styles.css` if you prefer a different file name or want to include additional formats (e.g., WOFF, TTF) for broader compatibility.
